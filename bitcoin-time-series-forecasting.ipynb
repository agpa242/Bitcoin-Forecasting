For example, the data of airline ticket sales per day is a time series. However, just because a series of events has a time element does not automatically make it a time series, such as the dates of major airline disasters, which are randomly spaced and are not time series. These types of random processes are known as point process.\n",

We can easily see from the **Data Exploration** section, that the Bitcoin prices were quite volatile and inconsistent over the years.

An RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network (or just LSTM). A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.
